INSATLLATION STEPS:
1)Java Project:
file---new--java projects--next--create java project [project name: salenium and 
JRE --javaSE1.8--click on finish.

2)create 2 folder in java project:
select project --right click--new--folder--folder name: jar and Drivers.

3) Download Automation Tool(SElenium)
   1.click on Download
   2.click on latest stable version 4.8.3
   3.it download salenium jar file.
4)Download Browser
   1.WWW.Selenium.dev---Download click on
   2.platform supported by Selenium--browser
   3. Go to crome --click on dacumentation
   4. click on latest satble release
   5. click on cromedriver_win32.zip

5) Add Selenium tools and Browser in project:
   1.go to download and paste the selenium server 4.8.3jar folder (into the eclipse)
   2.select jar file --right click --built path---add to built path
   3.it automatically crate one folder in project called reference libraries
   4.select crome driver zip file--right click---extract file
  5. open cromedriver_win32---copy cromedriver(exefile)--paste on driver

   SectionNotCreatedException ...go to google and help and check version 
                                   and crome driver.exe  are need to both version are  same i.e get this exception 
                                  i.e.delete crome driver.exe file and again download this file again 
                        (when browers is updated then give this exception)

In selenium :
.(dots)means current project .
/ (slash)means immediated child.

selenium architecture:
1.searchcontext is an interface .there are two method:
 1)findElement()-- we find SINGLE ELEMENT--return type---webElement

 2)findElements()--we use to find multiple element---return type---list<webElement>

2.takeScreenshot : we can take sreenshot in one element or full webpage
  method: takescreenshotas() .....only one method is there

3.javascript : use scrolling And popoff:
           method:  1)scrollOn()   2)scrollby()

4.web driver:
       method:
           1)get(): it is use to pass the url .
                    two type url:     1)mainUrl--only login page
                             2)subUrl--after clicking

        2)gettitle( ) : used to give the title on web page.

        3)getcurrentUrl() : used to get page url in home page

        4)getpagesource():
.
        5)close():It is used to close browser. it will closed only one window. 
                                               i.e. parent window is closed .

        6)quite() : It will close all windows .

        7)getwindowhandle() : It is used to provide the window id (only one window).
                                                   It is gives the id in parent window

        8)getwindowhandles() : (multiple window) gives multiple id's .
                              
        9)navigate(): It is going to provide the direction  of the  browser .
              ==> In this having 3 method:
                      I.back() 
                      II.forward() 
                      III.refresh() 
                      IV.to(String url) - get subURL

        10)manage() :
            a]manage windows related operation:
                   1.maximize()
                    2.minimize
                     3.fullscreen()
                     4.getsize()----return type is Dimension
                      5.setsize()-----return type is Dimension .create a variable 
                                                   after that pass the value in dimetion.and 
                                                    and variable passed in method setsize.
                       6.getPosition---return type is point
                        7setPosition----return type is point creat a variale and pass
                                                         the value and before luanching the pass
                                                        the value and  then called .

            b] manage timeout related:
            c]manage the cookies releted :
  

        11)Switch to (): It is used to control the driver control.
                                   with the help of id's .
 
        [1] TWO DIFFRERENCE BETWEEN CLOSED AND QUITE

               1.It will just closed  the window(closed).It is just close present window.
                2.In project always use quite. it is used to closed all windows.
      
          *Oods (object oriented 


                   1] If we are performing action on the targeted element.
                      we are going to call only Web Elments their are 14 method.

             ******Locator ********
                   locator nothing but the selector.locators having  8 type:
                     1.id(find single element)
                     2.name(find single element)
                     3.class
                     4.tagname
                      5.linktext
                      6.partial linktext
                      7.css : In locator css is the expression.

      Syntax:   tagname[attribute name='attribute value']

      when we go for css locator:  thair are not present the class ,
     id ,tagname ,linked then we go for css expression.

*   id and name is the best locator to find element.
*   class and tagname is the used to find elments.(duplicate)

*****advantage of css******
1.vary faster than xpath

 ****drawback(when you go for css is  having class, name ,tagname,id)

1.you can't perform backword travacy.
2.when your targeted element is having duplicates.it is can't be resolve
 by using css
3. targeted is having only the text that time css is not supported.

====================================================================================

In css some key point:
     1).(dot) : current project 
     2)/(slash):immediated
      3)//(doble slash);any child
      4)[]:index value start from 1.



8.xpath: xml markup lauguege 
        when :is targeted element  having only text
          when is targeted element having duplicate
          when is not having id,name and linked.

two type:
1.absolute xpath:from the root of the dacument.
                  lerthy. 
                  it is denoted by /


Drawback : it is very time comsumer.

 type of Relative Xpath:
     1) core relative
    ** 2)Xpath by Attribute
     **3) Xpath by Text
     *4)Xpath by contains
     *5)independent and dependent
     *6)xpath by group index
     7)xpath by group axes

1]core relative:
Expression :compare to absolute it is shortcut.
   1st way:  we have to go backwart direction until we will get 1of1.
    2way way: write first absolute xpath and then add the tag from the backward direction.      

      *drawback
1.it is having the index value . in this structure any element is added and
          any element remove to the structure that xpath change
=============================================================================


2]Xpath by attribute:
Expression://tagname[@attribute name='attribute value']

  example://img[@alt='Grocery']
***Drawbacks :
1.if your targerted having only the text .xpath by attribute is not going to get 1of 1
2.when your targeted element having duplicate value
3.
==============================================================================
3]Xpath by text:
Expression://tagname[text()='text value']
     example://div[text()='Travel']   

Condition:
  1. we have to passed the complete text value 
  2.case sensative
  3.it support both normal text and linked text .
    

drawback:
1.you can't passed the partial text value
2.if your text  value is having partial dynamic(changeble) value
    then it is not going to support.
if your targeted text having any space it is having non brokeble spaces.
========================================================================================

*4]Xpath by contains:
Expression:

i)Xpath by contains attribute : 
    //tagname[contains(@attribute name,'partial attribute value')]
  example : nokri.com
    //input[contains(@placeholder,'enter the usernmae and password')]

  ****  Advantage:*****
    it is going to work is complate text and partial text also.

ii)xpath by contains text :
      //tagname[contains(text(),'partial text value')]
ex: //nobr[contains(text()

Drawback:
     if your targeted element is having completely dyanamic 
       that time it is not going to suppport
     
========================================================
5]independent and dependent xpath:
    it is not having any syntax.
steps:
    1.identify which is fixed and which is dynamic
    2.write xpath for fixed element.
    *3.update the xpath by backward traversing to find common parent 
   between dynamic elment as well as fixed element
    4.update xpath by writting xpath for dynamic element
   
example:
steps:
1)//td[text(),'Buddhist train']           -----to find first fixed element
2)//td[text(),'Buddhist train']/..            --------then perform backward traversing
3)//td[text(),'Buddhist train']/..//td[@data title='helpline']   ----then perform backward as well as FE and DE


1)//td[text(),'Buddhist train']           
2)//td[text(),'Buddhist train']/..            
3)//td[text(),'Buddhist train']/..//td[@data title='mail']  

ex1]    //div[text()='realme C33 2023 (Night Sea, 64 GB)']/../..//div[@class='_30jeq3 _1_WHN1'] 
ex2]    ////div[text()='realme 9 (Stargaze White, 128 GB)'][1]/../..//div[@class='_30jeq3 _1_WHN1'][1]


 **** how to find backward traversing:   /..


drawback:
1.


==================================================
7]xpath by group axes
steps;
       1.child
       2.parent
        3'




1.click()


when where your targeted element is not supported get 
*element not intracteble exception.------change expression/change source code

4.get Attribute():
use :this method is going to pass attribute name  that attibute value it is
going to give 

attribute name give attribute  value.

when get null:
when td is not holding any value thet time to given to return empty or null
    
is empty ----true---td is empty
          ----false-----td is not \

****in web elemente  in this having a two method :
      get height(),getwidth()
     It is used to get size of single element .

      in this method set method is not here.
****gettagname
***if we  want to use submit method instance of clinking action.
         1. two contion is:compalsory td button as a tagname
                 <button type="submit">
           2.compalsory giving a form

and tE should have inside the form tagrgeted
 element and submit type is present inside the form tagname


*****isEnable:
   TE is disable---false----we can't perform action on this.
  if Te is disable in code we get the word called disabled.

**TE is enable ---true----is having tagname accept this  tagname (input and button)
---defaultly it will give true. 
**TE is  selected having two condition

Take Screenshot

steps:
1.create a folder 
2.create object of file
3absolute path for folder
4.move screenshot from temp location to destination location:
first create a folder and give a name and create one object
5.refresh the project: 


*how to create a folder automatically
step:you have to download the jar file which folder (io jar file)
1.FileUtils.copyFile(tempfile, destfile);  
//going to create a folder automatically

If we have to check the screenshot:
go to images folder right click .
go to properties file
go to location i.e. we have to get the sreenshot path

___________________________________________________________________
                  ***single Element ScreenShot***********

    *FileUtils.copyFile(tempfile, destfile); 
*_________________________________________________________________________________________
*****Select class**************
to handle the dropdown we are go for the select class.
it is concreate class.
it is use to handle single list and multi list
two type of dropdown:
1.single list
2.multi list

** in select class there are so many method;
in this 6 method is most important.
1.if its having select tagname then only we going for select class.
2. inside select class another tag called option tag

steps:create the select class:
1.we have to create object of the select
   select s=new select();
2.we are going to pass argument target input as
3.with the reference variable you can called the non static method.

**in this 6 non static method:
1.isMultiple():it is going to check for it is single list or multilist dropdown
                   if it is single we are get return type "false" and it is multilist we are get to  return " true".

2.getOption():if we want to get all the data it is return type is id's(list type).
                 if we are going to get single data
       Syntax:For Each(datatype refVariable:collection)
         
 List<WebElement> allmonth = s.getOptions();
	****       for(WebElement ele:allmonth) {
	    	   System.out.println(ele);
	       }
          ---->it is going to get all data id each month

                 **** List<WebElement> allmonth = s.getOptions();
	       for(WebElement ele:allmonth) {
	    	   System.out.println(ele.getText());
	       } 
                  ---->it is going to get all month text.

3.  selectByVIsibleText(): it is going to pass which text we are visible that text is going to pass. we are going to get that text.
                                       if we want all the text we are going to pass create a varible  and called it.

4.SelectByIndex():
          index value going to start from 0.
         ex :s.selectByIndex(11);
            ---->it is going to give index value as 11 .we are going to get  month is "dec".

5.SelectByValue():it is going to select the attribute by value we are going to get element
               ex:    s.selectByValue("Argentina");
            ---->it is going to give index value as is give me month is Argentina.

6.getFirstSelectedOption():
it is used in only multilist dropdown.if we give single list value it is going to give a default value.

====================================================================================================================================
*****ACTION CLASS*********
   With the help of action class we have to do action :
   **in action  class 21 method in there.
   
steps:(mouse releted action)
1.we have to create the object of actions
   Action a=new Action();
2. in action constructor going to pass argument webdriver reference.
   Action a =new Action(driver);
3.with the reference variable call non static method
     a.click()
4.call a perform().

  **********Action class method**************
      1.movetoElement(webElement target)
      2.contextclick(WebElement target ) or right click  (used to right click)
      3.contextClick();
      4.doubleClick( WebElement target);
     5.doubleClick();
     6.click();
     7.click(WebElement terget);
    8.click&hold();
   9.click &hold(Webelement target)
   10.drag&drop()
   11.release()
   12.relaese(webElment)
  13.MoveToElement(WebElment,intX offset,int Y offset)
  14.moveByOffset();this method is 
  15.sendKeys(char sequence)
  18.perform():if we are not calling a performd method it is not going to do any action .
                    it is used to performed the action on web browser.
   19.KeyUp()
   20.keyDown()
  21.drag&dropby(): if are going to performed this method not give any action


we are giving exception
      here we are switch to concept
***SwitchTo:
*use of send keys in Action class:

          HANDLING FRAMES:
****** embeded webpage : one web page inside other web page .
                                                

    ***********How to handle the frame**********
  1.   we have check target element present inside the frame or not
how:goto td-- right click--- get two componend : reload and view frame
(when we agr TE is present inside the frame going to get this option)
  *it's parent and ancitor is having <iframe> tag 

2.we have to transfer the driver control by using switch to method.
   there are mainy  three way:
   i ) by index value :driver.switchto().frame(int index)---- it is  faster 
   ii)by id or name:   driver.switchto().frame(id/name)---we have to search in iframe tag only 
   iii)by targeted element:driver.switchto().frame(targeted element)----check getting one of one css 

3.indentify the targeted element 

go to download git--- download for win --click--64-win setup
goto downl;oad autoit---and download
=========================================================
   ************   JAVASCRIPT EXECUTOR***********
      If click() and sendKeys()is raturn the fails then we go for javascript.
   when the disable element is not perform manully we can't perform in  automation.
it is not doing manully then we can't perform using automation.if manully is not possible how is possible in automotion.

********POPUP**********
    popup is gui(graphical user interface) window which comes on the top of the another window .
   differenet type of popup:
   i]Javascript 
ii]hidden division--this is only possible  only locator.
iii]file upload--we can handle the popup using tools.
iv]notification---to ask the permission of the user.
v]authentication.

***  how to handle the popup:(It try to click on allow or not)

 1] it is possible to  first right click. it is inspectable or not.if is not inspectable.
 2]we have to see any solution is their your automation tools.(selenium)
 3]we have any solution is their in programming langauge to avoid that popup.
 4]you have to see any solution in the 3rd  party tools to handle the popup.
  5]try to avoid popup.
 ( without giving response we want perform any action).

 ***i] Javascript :  it is blocker popup.   

  thair are three type popup:
       1.alert :  it wiil having only "ok"button.
        2.confirmation : it wiil having only" ok" and " cancel" button.
        3.prompt : it wiil having 'textfield' ,' ok'and 'cancel' button. 
	
  ********  To avoid the popup:
*** create the object of browser class.
     chromeOptions opt=new chromeOptions();
        opt.addArgument("--disable-notifications");   

****file uploading:
    how to upload the file :
    autoit script: It is used to automate the standalone application.
defult lacation :c:drive.
   go to google --search autoit---download .
   download--open --click--next --up to finish.

    ***go to c :drive--program file(*86)--autoit--open .
    *go to autoit--index--search--controlFocus---copy -- paste sceit---and --controlSetText---copy --
    **paste scit---and---controlClick---copy -- paste sciIt .

     steps: 
________________________________________________________________________________________
   i.ControlFocus ( "title", "text", controlID )
   ii.ControlSetText ( "title", "text", controlID, "new text" [, flag = 0] )
   iii.ControlClick ( "title", "text", controlID [, button = "left" [, clicks = 1 [, x [, y]]]] )
_________________________________________________________________________________________
   i.ControlFocus ( "Open", "", "Edit1" )
   ii.ControlSetText ( "Open", "", "Edit1", "E:\Selenium notes\Software info.txt"  )
   iii.ControlClick ( "Open", "", "Button1"  )
   iv.Save the file as filename.au3(extention).
   v.after that compile the file.--go to tools ---compile--click
   vi.go to that location where have save the file &give same name file .exe file.
   vii. go to properties file search location.
******Runtime.getRuntime().exec("C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Practice.exe");
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
  ****google***        
 its ansistor it is having the iframe tag.we perform one window inside another window
then we write a line SwitchTo().frame();
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

____________________________________________________________________________________________
*****Auto Suggestion****************
Steps:
go to google---search whenever you want--[selenium]
----give one than more auto suggesttion.
---- start closing the  all the tag until() we get all the auto suggestion
---we get source code of auto Suggestion one below another

Xpath in FindElments:
//li[@class='sbct' and not(@id='YMxe') and not(@id='mitGyb')]

example 1:
//li====45 duplicate
//li[@class='sbct']===12
//li[@class='sbct' and not(@id='YMXe')]=====11
//li[@class='sbct' and not(@id='YMXe') and not(@id='mitGyb')]===10
//li[@class='sbct' and not(@id='YMXe') and (@id='mitGyb')]===1 of 1
//li[@class='sbct' and (@id='YMXe') and not(@id='mitGyb')]===1 of 1

Example 2:

//li[@role='presentation']===12
//li[@role='presentation' and @id='YMXe']===1 of 1
//li[@role='presentation' and not(@id='YMXe') and not(@id='mitGyb')]===10

Example 3: Defult Auto-suggetion:

**********MAVEN INASTALLATION**********
Steps: in ecclips:
1.Go to file --> new ----->Project------>select a Wizard(Maven Folder)----->select maven project---->
click on next------>click on checkbox (create a simple Project)----->
click on next------->enter group id and artifind id---- finish

delete Maven: when error in maven project creation.
go to c drive :C:\Users\Admin\.m2 delete this path.

Group id :Maven
artifiend id:Maven
==============================================================================================================
why are going to maven project:

Advantage of maven project:
in java project if selenium version is updated that time we have to change the version
first we have to delete the current version and after that download the new version and paste in selenium project.

*in maven we don't want to delete the jar we want to change only the version (not need to download here)
this is a 


how to add tools for maven project:
1. go to pom.xml
2.add tag called dependencies inside the project
3.to add tools

Maven reposistory(global repository) :it is based it is auotomatically we save all the tools
     .m2 is called as local repository.  this is depenedency tag
    
HTML REPORT:
      after the refresh the maven project go to test/output folfer we have to ---
get emailable report ---right click ---open with web browser.

   *with the hepl of testng we have to pass
**testNG.xml

SELECT THE CLASS we have execute : right click---getting  testNg---getting to 2 option---
selectt convert in testng---finish

  ****Complete maven project is control by pom.xml.

  ****1.group excution
        2.
=====================================================================
       *****  Pom concept(advance selenium)

       ****  staleElementReferneceException.
              driver.navigate().refresh().

                                                          // Bcoz of that we are giving that exception . 
             ...... Bcoz when we refresh ele address is going to change  i.e. we giving to get this exception .
                to avoid that exception by using pom.

 ** ref var.clear()  ----> It is giving to work.

            advatage of pom :
             1.staleElementRefernceException is avoid that exeption .

**cross browser testing ***
means attime both the browser is launch.
1.copy tag 
2.copy paste change name
3.chnage name of the browser.any one browser change the name.

**we have lauch multiple browser to copy the code and paste .

__________________________________________________________________________________________

***annotation*****
1.@test
2.@parameter
3.

flow of annotation:
@before suit ---@before test--@before class--@before method---@test--@after method ---@after clas--@after test----@after suit.
   most use :method and class 

@test:
@before and after class it will be exute only ones.it is use open and close the browser.

***Assert****
1.assert
2.assertion
3.checkbox

1.assert:  It is possible without condtion (if else)

**assert are two type :(it is condition)
1.hard assert
2.soft assert

1.hard assert  : If in the application having *(mandantory)field .
               It is used  in madantory filed .
In hard assert we are going to used only static method.\

--> static method 
--->if condition is satisfy  control will be release to next line.
 Static Methods.
--->in this 4 method :
   1.assertEqual
2.assertTrue
3.assrteFalse

***Condition will be :
1.checkbox:isSelected
2.checkBox :isDisplayed.
#.checkBox:isEnable.

*soft assert :
It Is Not used in madantory field.In Soft assert we are going to used only non-static method.

-->non static method 
--->if condition is satisfy.  control will not  be release to next line.

non Static Methods.
--->in this 4 method :
   1.assertEqual
2.assertTrue
3.assrteFalse
4.assertall---->don't forgotte assertall method it is compaulsory in soft ASSERT.

**************pom*******
         *pom stand:page object model/object repository/element repository
***advantages Of POM:
1.avoid staleElmentRefernceException.
2.reusability code 
3redabiltyof code
4 maintaince effort

*    it is design pattern 
     which gives solution for frequently occuring problem .

steps:(Procedure):

     1.create seperate class for all pages.and in suffix page.Login page ,homepage.we have to crete two class 1.login 2.homepage
     ( along with that in suffix we have to call page)
     2.pass all credentials inrespective java class.
     3.we have to make the element as privent and call getter method.
  * 4.@findBy()----to find elment 
    why go bcoz avoid exception.
        driver.fibndElement(By.id());
        @findBy(id="idvalue);
        Privent WebElement ele;
   5.pagefactory.intElement(,)
        to in intilize@Findby()
    6.base class
     7 action class.
